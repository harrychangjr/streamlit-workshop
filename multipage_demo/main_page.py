# To run web app with multiple pages, run 'streamlit main_page.py' on your terminal

'''
As apps grow large, it becomes useful to organize them into multiple pages. 
This makes the app easier to manage as a developer and easier to navigate as a user. 
Streamlit provides a frictionless way to create multipage apps.

We designed this feature so that building a multipage app is as easy as building a single-page app! 
Just add more pages to an existing app as follows:

In the folder containing your main script, create a new pages folder. Letâ€™s say your main script is named main_page.py.
Add new .py files in the pages folder to add more pages to your app.
Run streamlit run main_page.py as usual.
Thatâ€™s it! The main_page.py script will now correspond to the main page of your app.
And youâ€™ll see the other scripts from the pages folder in the sidebar page selector. The pages are listed according to filename (without file extensions and disregarding underscores).
