Multipage Streamlit apps are useful when we want to organise our data and functionalities.
To get started, you just need to have the main_page and another folder containing the scripts for the other pages

    2. Streamlit Components
    3. Sample Data Uses

Based on: [Data Collection] -> [Data Analysis] -> [Data Modelling]
