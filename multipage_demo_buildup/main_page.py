Multipage Streamlit apps are useful when we want to organise our data and functionalities.
To get started, you just need to have the main_page and another folder containing the scripts for the other pages

This section showcases:
    1. Using multiple pages (file structure and persisting variables)
    2. Waiting for excecution
    3. Sample Data Uses
    4. Streamlit components

              main_page            page_2             page_3
Based on: [Data Collection] -> [Data Analysis] -> [Data Modelling]

Let's Begin!
