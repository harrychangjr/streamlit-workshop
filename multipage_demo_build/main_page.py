Multipage Streamlit apps are useful when we want to organise our data and functionalities.
To get started, you just need to have the main_page and another folder containing the scripts for the other pages

This demo showcases:\n
    1. Using multiple pages (file structure and persisting variables)\n
    2. Waiting for excecution\n
    3. Sample Data Uses\n
    4. Streamlit components\n

Based on [Data Collection] -> [Data Analysis] -> [Data Modelling]

Let's Begin!
